## Phase 3 — Normalization Sprint 🟡 IN PROGRESS

**Goal:** Resolve all 4 critical blockers. Blocker detail: docs/validation/SYSTEM_VALIDATION_REPORT.md

- [x] **Step 1 (CODE):** Migrate suggestions pipeline — vault.py, sentinel.py, librarian.py, watchdog.py → `db_helpers.post_suggestion()`
- [x] **Step 2 (CODE):** Migrate watchdog.py post_deploy_watch read → `db_helpers.get_active_deploy_watches()`
- [x] **Step 3 (CODE):** Fix `watchdog.py` hardcoded `COMPANY_DATA_DIR` → introduce `COMPANY_DATA_DIR` env var`
- [x] **Step 4 (FILE MOVE):** Move strongbox.py to synthos-company/agents/; verify running
- [ ] **Step 5 (DOC):** Update docs/specs/SYNTHOS_TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md DB schema to v1.2 reality (PRAGMA table_info output)
- [ ] **Step 6 (HUMAN DECISION):** Declare license_validator.py status — (a) build now or (b) strike from all requirements and defer

Secondary (required before Phase 4):
- [ ] Mark SUGGESTIONS_JSON_SPEC.md as SUPERSEDED
- [ ] Mark POST_DEPLOY_WATCH_SPEC.md as SUPERSEDED
- [ ] Update SYSTEM_MANIFEST.md (v1.2 env vars, install.py deprecated, ADDENDUM_2 speculative)
- [ ] Boot SMS alert (boot_sequence.py smtplib) — route through MONITOR_URL or document exception

## Phase 4 — Ground Truth Declaration 🔴 NOT STARTED

**Gate condition:** All Phase 3 steps complete. See docs/validation/GROUND_TRUTH_READINESS.md.

- [ ] Run PRAGMA table_info on both signals.db and company.db — extract live schema
- [ ] Update docs/validation/SYNTHOS_GROUND_TRUTH.md to v1.2
- [ ] Confirm all active processes match manifest
- [ ] Confirm suggestions store state on company Pi
- [ ] Declare new ground truth — commit and tag

---

## Phase 5 — Deployment Pipeline 🔴 NOT STARTED

- [ ] Create update-staging git branch
- [ ] Document actual Friday push process (update SYNTHOS_OPERATIONS_SPEC.md)
- [ ] First end-to-end deploy test in paper mode
- [ ] Verify post-deploy rollback trigger fires correctly
- [ ] Verify watchdog known-good snapshot and restore

---

## Phase 6 — Live Trading Gate 🔴 NOT STARTED

**This phase requires explicit human decision. No code change flips this.**

- [ ] Paper trading review — minimum 30-day clean run
- [ ] All validation checks passing
- [ ] Project lead approval documented
- [ ] TRADING_MODE=LIVE set by project lead only
