# SYNTHOS INSTALLER ARCHITECTURE
## Implementation-Ready Specification + Full Code

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-03-26  
**Authority:** SYSTEM_MANIFEST.md v2.0 (ground truth)  
**Addendum:** SYNTHOS_OPERATIONS_SPEC_ADDENDUM_1.md v1.0  
**Status:** Implementation-ready

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE DECISION SUMMARY

### Architectural Decisions Made

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Folder name — retail | `synthos-retail/` | Manifest v2.0 node_specific.retail_node |
| Folder name — company | `synthos-company/` | Manifest v2.0 node_specific.company_node |
| Retail installer | `install_retail.py` replaces `install.py` as the canonical installer | `install.py` violates addendum rule 1 (hardcoded paths). New file is the clean implementation. Old `install.py` is superseded. |
| Company installer | `install_company.py` — greenfield | No equivalent exists. Bootstraps company node from USB-copied files. |
| Startup mechanism | **cron only** | Manifest lifecycle section specifies cron exclusively. No systemd. `@reboot` for persistent processes, scheduled entries for agents. |
| Company DB init | **Installer directly** | Addendum 3.1 restore sequence shows DB restored at install time. `db_helpers.py` bootstraps schema on import but installer must create the file and dirs first. |
| Company services layout | **`agents/` only** | Manifest FILE_LOCATIONS company_node lists all files under `${SYNTHOS_HOME}/agents/`. No `services/` subdirectory. |
| License validation at retail install | **Collect key, write to `.env`, defer validation to `boot_sequence.py`** | Addendum 2.3: validation flow starts at boot. Installer has no network path to Vault. Key format recorded; Vault validates on first boot. |
| Company restore scope | **Phase-1 bootstrap only** | Full restore workflow (Strongbox) is pre-approved but not implemented. Installer creates restore-friendly structure; `restore.sh` is out of scope for this spec. |
| Protected files at retail rerun | **Hard list from manifest UPGRADE_RULES** | `user/.env`, `data/signals.db`, `data/backup/`, `.known_good/`, `consent_log.jsonl` |
| Shared helpers location | `installers/common/` | Direction item 6. |
| Installer log location | `logs/install.log` under respective `SYNTHOS_HOME` | Consistent with all other tool log locations. |
| Retail completion sentinel | `synthos-retail/.install_complete` | Manifest runtime_files.install_complete = `${SYNTHOS_HOME}/.install_complete` |
| Company completion sentinel | `synthos-company/.install_complete` | Same pattern, separate system. |
| Python minimum | 3.9 | Manifest EXECUTION_CONTEXT |
| pip flag | `--break-system-packages` on Pi OS | Manifest EXECUTION_CONTEXT |

### Conflict Resolution

**Conflict:** Architecture docs reference `/home/pi/synthos/` paths throughout. Addendum 1 explicitly prohibits this.  
**Resolution:** All paths in both installers derive from `Path(__file__).resolve().parent`. No hardcoded user paths anywhere.

**Conflict:** `install.py` exists and is listed as active in FILE_STATUS. The prompt requires `install_retail.py`.  
**Resolution:** `install_retail.py` is the new canonical retail installer. `install.py` is the predecessor. Both can coexist during transition. New deployments use `install_retail.py`.

**Conflict:** Manifest agent names use aliases (Bolt, Scout, Pulse) but file names are `agent1_trader.py`, etc.  
**Resolution:** File names are canonical (manifest FILE_REGISTRY). Aliases are display names only.

## 2. EXPLICIT INSTALLER ARCHITECTURE

### install_retail.py

**Purpose:** First-time setup and safe rerun/repair for a retail customer Pi.

**Responsibilities:**
- Preflight: validate Python version, check for required system tools
- Detect prior install state from `.install_progress.json`; resume safely
- Collect customer configuration via local web wizard (Flask on port 8080)
- Write `user/.env` safely — never overwrite without backup
- Create all required directories
- Install Python packages via pip
- Register cron schedule using resolved absolute paths
- Set timezone to America/New_York
- Bootstrap `data/signals.db` schema via `database.py`
- Run `health_check.py` to verify
- Write `.install_complete` sentinel on success

**NOT responsible for:**
- Company agent installation or configuration
- Vault key generation (operator tool, not on Pi)
- License validation (boot_sequence.py owns this)
- Network tunnel setup
- GitHub repo cloning (files arrive by USB)

**Protected files — never touched on rerun:**
- `user/.env` (backed up, never overwritten)
- `data/signals.db`
- `data/backup/`
- `.known_good/`
- `user/agreements/`
- `consent_log.jsonl`

---

### install_company.py

**Purpose:** Bootstrap the company operations Pi from USB-copied files.

**Responsibilities:**
- Preflight: validate Python version, system tools
- Detect prior install state; resume safely
- Collect company configuration via CLI prompts (no web wizard — internal tool)
- Write `company.env` safely
- Create all required directories under `synthos-company/`
- Install Python packages via pip
- Initialize `data/company.db` schema directly via `db_helpers.py`
- Register cron schedule using resolved absolute paths
- Write `.install_complete` sentinel on success

**NOT responsible for:**
- Retail agent installation or configuration
- License key generation (operator tool, separate machine)
- Customer onboarding flow
- Cloudflare tunnel setup (separate `setup_tunnel.sh`)
- Full restore workflow (Strongbox, future)

**No retail dependency:**
- No license key collected or validated
- No Alpaca / Congress.gov / trading API setup
- No `OPERATING_MODE` or `AUTONOMOUS_UNLOCK_KEY` fields
- `COMPANY_MODE=true` written to env; all agents skip license checks

## 8. FILE PLAN

| File | Action | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `synthos-retail/install_retail.py` | CREATE | Retail installer entry point |
| `synthos-company/install_company.py` | CREATE | Company installer entry point |
| `synthos-retail/installers/common/__init__.py` | CREATE | Package marker |
| `synthos-retail/installers/common/preflight.py` | CREATE | Shared preflight checks |
| `synthos-retail/installers/common/env_writer.py` | CREATE | Safe env file writer |
| `synthos-retail/installers/common/progress.py` | CREATE | Install progress state manager |
| `synthos-company/installers/common/` | SYMLINK or COPY | Same helpers, company side |

> **Note:** `installers/common/` is duplicated into both deployment trees. These are USB-copied deployments — no shared filesystem between retail and company Pi. The common helpers are identical files in both trees.

---

## 9. IMPLEMENTATION

See attached files:
- `install_retail.py`
- `install_company.py`
- `installers/common/preflight.py`
- `installers/common/env_writer.py`
- `installers/common/progress.py`

---

## 10. OPERATOR RUNBOOK

### Install from USB

**Retail:**
```bash
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/usb
cp -r /mnt/usb/synthos-retail ~/synthos-retail
cd ~/synthos-retail
python3 install_retail.py
# Open browser on same LAN: http://<pi>.local:8080
# Complete wizard. Wait for "Installation complete."
cat .install_complete   # confirm sentinel exists
```

**Company:**
```bash
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/usb
cp -r /mnt/usb/synthos-company ~/synthos-company
cd ~/synthos-company
python3 install_company.py
# Follow CLI prompts.
cat .install_complete   # confirm sentinel exists
```

### Rerun / Repair

```bash
python3 install_retail.py --repair   # retail
python3 install_company.py --repair  # company
```

Repair mode re-runs INSTALLING and VERIFYING. Skips COLLECTING if `user/.env` exists. Never overwrites protected files.

### Where Logs Go

| Log | Path |
|---|---|
| Retail installer | `synthos-retail/logs/install.log` |
| Company installer | `synthos-company/logs/install.log` |
| Retail boot | `synthos-retail/logs/boot.log` |
| Retail health | `synthos-retail/logs/health.log` |

### Verify Success

```bash
# Retail
cat synthos-retail/.install_complete

# Company
cat synthos-company/.install_complete

# Both return JSON: {version, installed_at, synthos_home, ...}
```

---

## 11. OPEN RISKS / FOLLOW-UP ITEMS

| Item | Risk | Decision Made |
|---|---|---|
| `install.py` still present in repo | Operators may run the old installer by mistake | Decided: `install_retail.py` is canonical. Old `install.py` should be renamed `install.py.deprecated` after this ships. |
| License validation at install | Installer collects key but cannot validate it (no Vault yet) | Decided: collect and write to `.env`. `boot_sequence.py` validates on first boot. Customer sees clear error if key is wrong — not a silent failure. |
| `first_run.sh` hardcodes `/home/pi/synthos` | Flagged in manifest as experimental/known issue | Out of scope for installers. Separate refactor task. |
| Company restore workflow | Addendum 3.1 describes `restore.sh` but it doesn't exist | Out of scope for this spec. Strongbox (Agent 12) owns this when implemented. |
| `seed_backlog.py` for company | Should run after company install to bootstrap agent suggestion queue | Not wired into installer yet. Operator runs manually after install: `python3 agents/../seed_backlog.py` |
| Pi platform check | Installer warns on non-Pi but continues | Correct behavior per manifest EXECUTION_CONTEXT. |
